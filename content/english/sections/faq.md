## Getting Started

{{< accordion class="faq-accordion" title="Why should I choose EUmail over competitors?" >}}

Good quetion. There are some really great products out there already. All users are welcome - but we belive that for European customers we are the safe option when you care about GDPR and want a solution that is developed and delivered entirely from within Europe. No need for special contractual clauses, data privacy framework etc. Eumail is completely european and thus inherently GDPR compliant.

{{< accordion class="faq-accordion" title="How does free trial work?" >}}
First of all - it’s not really a trial but a full free version. There are limitations though. The conditions at the time of your signup will be yours as long as you stay on that plan. We may change conditions on all our plans in the future, but they will only apply to accounts created after the change.

{{< accordion class="faq-accordion" title="Can I change/cancel my plan?" >}}
Yes. You can change and cancel your plan at any time. We reserve the right to delay downgrades until the end of the period currently paid for.

{{< accordion class="faq-accordion" title="Can I use EUmail with my favorite Email designe program?" >}}
