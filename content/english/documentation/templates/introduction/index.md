As you have probably read in the [Introduction](/documentation/getting-started/introduction/) you need a HTML template to send emails using EUmail. The template will define how all the static parts of the email looks like.

And to make a template you also need an editor - and not just any editor, but one specifically to create HTML for emails.


## Why do you need a email HTML editor

Like most other transactional email services EUmail also includes a buildt-in editor to create and maintain email templates.

Why is this necessary? - you could ask. The reason is that email clients support HTML very inconsitantly and this makes it rather difficult to create HTML emails and work and look ok on all the different email clients.

Email editors like [Alpaco](https://alpaco.email/) , [Stripo](https://stripo.email/) and the [EUmail build-in editor](https://app.mandaa.io/documentation/templates/eumail_templates/) apply extra code to various parts of the email HTML to counter the shortcommings on various email systems. Unfortunately there is no single place where you can learn what works and what does not, so only experience plus trial and error have given us the knowledge on how to do this.
